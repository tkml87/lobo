# HOWLING BOOKS

"Howling Books" is a podcast of a fictional (werewolf) character who tells stories to werewolves pups around a fire at night in a forest as it is the role of a Galliard of the werewolves.

This website intends to inform the audience about new releases and news about the podcast as the reason why it might get an episode delayed or any announcement that needs to be made to the audience.

## User Experience (UX)

Howling Books is an audio-sharing project that makes books more accessible for people with reading difficulty, using mainly Spotify as a platform to publish the audio. As a non-profitable project, it does not make use of any ADs or any means of donation, so it does not ask for donations or monetary help from the audience in any way.

The owner does have a full-time job and other daily matters and is in a distant timezone, and occasionally may not post the weekly update to the podcast.

Key information for the site:
- What are the current book and the chapters uploaded
- What will be the next book.
- How to help the podcast by participating in the reading voicing over a character.
- A way for people to contact the book club with questions and recommendations.
- Updates on what is coming to the podcast.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

Given the dark atmosphere of a forest, where young werewolves receive their knowledge from the stories told by the pack leader while gathered around a campfire, I have chosen the following color palette:
(foto da paleta) *site da paleta <http://colormind.io/bootstrap/>

### Typography

For the same reason, the fonts were chosen accordingly: Creepster to bring suspense in the headings and Lato to make the paragraphs more reader-friendly, since the first font is too heavy for reading long texts

<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Creepster>
(foto da fonte)

<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato>
(foto da fonte)

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was my choice for importing fonts to use in my project, as it doesn't require me to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

All the images used are from one of these sources:
- Public Repository.
- AI generated images, as Dall-E <https://labs.openai.com/>.
- Official medias or web pages of the book read.
When none of these 3 options, the image used is linked to the source and the signature is always left visible when present.

## Features

The website comprises the "Home" page, the "Chapters" page, the "About Me" page, and a "404 error" page. The "Home" page has a link to an interactive application form page in "the Project" section.

#### The Home Page
The home page of Howling Books displays the phrase "Welcome to the Howling Books" as a title and then a section that holds a text summarizing what the project is about. Below this the links to social media and the platforms where the project is posted.

#### The Chapters Page
The Chapters page displays the phrase "Welcome to the Howling Books" as a title and has a sub-title indicating that here you can find the released chapters as a photo gallery in which each picture links the user to its own chapter.

#### The About Me page
The About Me page displays the site's name as a title. It also contains a text about the owner and not the character he portrays during the readings and how he got to do the project. It also has an AI-generated image of a wolf pup with a tophat reading a book.

#### The 404 error page
The 404 error page also displays the site's name as a title. Within the page container, there is a message explaining to the users that there has a directing error to the page they were looking for. So them can return to the requested page through the three buttons that redirect them to other pages on the site: the Home page, the About Me page, and the Chapters page.

#### The Interactive application form page
A book consists of a magical world of characters and plots. The author cannot always perform at his best with the voices necessary to tell a good story. To solve this, within "The Project" section on the home page, there is a link that teleports users to a form that asks for some contact information and the character the user would like to play together with the author in the next book they might narrate together.

### General features on each page

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab. <https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/wolf>
* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.
* Also the footer of the site at the bottom of every page. It has icons that redirect the user to the social media webpages.

### Future Implementations

Since the podcast audience is mostly Portuguese speakers and listeners, a late addition will be to translate this web page for these users.

Besides that, it is still in the process to add the idea of this Swiss company (https://bionic-reading.com/) to help dyslexic people to read the site more easily.

### Accessibility

The author plans to voice reading what is writen for people who are not able to read easily without aid. A change of the colors may happen in the future also, to improve the user's experience.

## Credits

### Code Used

The Interactive Application Form page was mostly based on the codes used in this class from [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LR101+2021_T1/courseware/4a07c57382724cfda5834497317f24d5/4d85cd1a2c57485abbd8ccec8c00732c/).

The [Love Running project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode) also helped me a lot to fulfill the end of this project.

Another big help I had was from [Andy Guttridge](https://github.com/andy-guttridge/tails-up). I was lost about how to create a 404 page.

I also had some help from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

### Content

All the content for the website, such as introduction messages and instructions were written by myself, my husband Lu√≠s Eduardo H. de F. Pereira (Client/Owner) and Andreia D'Alessandro (friend/helper).

This Readme was generated based on the Code Institute instructions [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME). For its sintaxe, the guidance from Github [here](https://docs.github.com/pt/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#syntax). I also followed the instructions here: [Kera Cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/README.md) was a life-saver.

I also used [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) and [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to proofread my content.
