# MILESTONE 1 - HOWLING BOOKS - TESTING DOCUMENTATION

"Howling Books" is a podcast of a fictional (werewolf) character who tells stories to werewolves pups around a fire at night in a forest as it is the role of a Galliard of the werewolves.

This website intends to inform the audience about new releases and news about the podcast as the reason why it might get an episode delayed or any announcement that needs to be made to the audience.

All during the build, testing was ongoing. While developing, I used the developer tools in Chrome to identify and fix any problems as they arose.

To make sure that each page is fully responsive on a range of different screen sizes and devices, each page has been examined using the Google Chrome Developer Tools, Brave Browser and Tor. On a variety of actual devices, the site's responsiveness was also evaluated.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

The Automated Testing includes all the testing that is carried out by a program, like W3C HTML validation.

### W3C Validator

W3C was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.
